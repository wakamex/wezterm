## About this fork

This is an actively maintained fork of [wezterm/wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm). Upstream development has slowed, and this fork fixes bugs that affect daily mux server usage.

### What's changed

**Bug fixes** — see [CHANGELOG-FORK.md](CHANGELOG-FORK.md) for details:

- Nested split pane sizes diverging after window resize (#6052, #5011, #5117)
- Infinite loop when shrinking window with splits (#4878)
- OOM crash from oversized PDU allocation (#7527)
- GUI deadlock on tmux CC domain detach (#7661)
- Pane rotation not syncing to mux server (#6397)
- `--attach` flag ignored when delegating to running instance (#7582)
- Tab size wrong after top-level split (#7654, #2579, #4984)
- tmux CC parser error on empty line during detach (#7656)
- Resize feedback loop between client and server
- GUI clamp for zero-dimension resize requests

**Session persistence** — tabs survive server restarts:
- Auto-saves tab layout, split tree structure, working directories, and titles every 60s and on SIGTERM
- Auto-restores on startup with correct nested splits, proportional sizing, and active-tab selection
- `wezterm cli save-layout` / `wezterm cli restore-layout` for exact Rust-backed manual snapshots, replay, and active-tab restore

**Window geometry** — macOS remembers window position and size across restarts via native `NSWindow` autosave

**Resize stability:**
- Batched `ResizeTab` PDU prevents per-pane interleaving
- Spawn sizing now uses the live tab/window size across CLI spawn, GUI delegation, and mux server split flows
- Server suppresses self-echo `TabResized` to break feedback loops while forwarding to other clients
- Resync debounce queues instead of drops overlapping requests

**Observability:**
- Always-on `size-trace` logging for spawn, split, tab resize, and client/server `ResizeTab` traffic
- Mux server logs hard errors for `ResizeTab` pane-count mismatches, unknown pane ids, and split-tree invariant failures
- `check-pane-layout.py` validates live `wezterm cli list --format json` output against a legal split tree

**Tab titles** — user-set titles (via Ctrl+Shift+<) are no longer overwritten by terminal escape sequences

**5 new default key bindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+D (Cmd+D) | Close current pane |
| Shift+Home | Scroll to top |
| Shift+End | Scroll to bottom |
| Ctrl+Shift+O (Cmd+O) | Rotate panes clockwise |
| Ctrl+Shift+E (Cmd+E) | Tab navigator |

### Compatibility

- Codec version 48
- Both client and server should run this fork for full functionality
- No backwards-compatibility shims for removed fork-only tooling such as `wez-tabs`

## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you're welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions
than bug reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable
using and we'll work it out.
