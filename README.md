# wakterm (wakamex fork)

This is an actively maintained fork of [wezterm/wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm), extending it with fixes and features for daily mux server usage. I also took the opportunity to make agent harnesses first-class citizens 🤖.

### What's changed

See [CHANGELOG-FORK.md](CHANGELOG-FORK.md) for the detailed fork fix history.

**Session persistence**
- Auto-saves tab layout, split tree structure, working directories, and titles every 60s and on SIGTERM
- Auto-restores on startup with correct nested splits, proportional sizing, and active-tab selection
- `wakterm cli save-layout` / `wakterm cli restore-layout` for exact Rust-backed manual snapshots, replay, and active-tab restore
- Mux server memory monitoring: logs RSS and per-pane buffer sizes every 60s (at `WAKTERM_LOG=info`)
- Fixed upstream OOM where stuck SynchronizedOutput caused unbounded memory growth ([details](docs/mux-server-memory.md))

**Agent harnesses**
- Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode are first-class citizens
- Start them directly with `wakterm cli agent start claude|codex|gemini|opencode`
- Watch live progress across running harnesses with `wakterm cli agent watch` or `wakterm cli agent list -f`
- Send prompts and interrupts through wakterm while keeping the real harness UI in the pane
- Tab title tells you if an agent is waiting on you, or if it's your turn (configurable)
- `agent` is a shortcut for `wakterm cli agent`

**Usability**
- macOS remembers window position and size across restarts via native `NSWindow` autosave
- Divider drags, window resizes, and spawned panes agree on the same layout more often
- Multi-client sessions are much less prone to flickering, jumpy redraws, and resize feedback loops
- User-set titles (via Ctrl+Shift+<) are no longer overwritten by terminal escape sequences

**6 new default key bindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+D (Cmd+D) | Close current pane |
| Shift+Home | Scroll to top |
| Shift+End | Scroll to bottom |
| Ctrl+Shift+O (Cmd+O) | Rotate panes clockwise |
| Ctrl+Shift+E (Cmd+E) | Tab navigator |
| Ctrl+Shift+< (Cmd+<) | Rename current tab |
