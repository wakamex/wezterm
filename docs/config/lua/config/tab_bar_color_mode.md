# `tab_bar_color_mode = "Off"`

Controls built-in per-tab background coloring in the tab bar.

Possible values are:

- `"Off"`: disable built-in tab color assignment
- `"Hash"`: deterministically hash each tab identity to a generated color
- `"Assign"`: persist first-seen tab identities and assign new colors to stay distinct from prior assignments

When assigning colors, wakterm keys each tab by:

- the explicit tab title, if set
- otherwise the right-most segment of the active pane cwd
- otherwise the effective title

`"Assign"` persists these key-to-color assignments across sessions.

Generated colors are only applied when your `format-tab-title` callback has
not already set explicit foreground/background colors for the tab.

The default is `"Off"`.
