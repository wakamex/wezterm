## Features

wakterm keeps the core WezTerm feature set, with extra focus on mux
reliability, persistent layouts, and agent-driven workflows.

## Fork Highlights

* Persistent layouts: auto-save and restore tabs, split trees, working
  directories, titles, and active-tab selection across mux server restarts
* Manual layout snapshots via `wakterm cli save-layout` and
  `wakterm cli restore-layout`
* First-class agent harness panes for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode
* Live agent progress with `wakterm cli agent watch` and
  `wakterm cli agent list -f`
* Prompt send and interrupt flows that keep the real harness UI in the pane
* Better multi-client mux behavior, including fewer flickers, redraw storms,
  and resize feedback loops
* More reliable split and spawn sizing so panes agree on the same layout more
  often across clients
* User-set tab titles are preserved instead of being overwritten by terminal
  escape sequences
